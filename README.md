Our graduation project at the first term in the forth grade on my faculty 

## Absraction
Have you ever searched in a video?
Sure, we all searched for a video before, but we didn't look for something in a video like a word, a picture, a sound, or an object inside a video, So we decided to produce a software that does these features.

  Detecting and tracking moving objects in video files has wide range of applications in real life. If a person just watches a video file, human eyes will not be able to give specific details about the time and the process of changing location of objects, especially those with a fast change process such as detection of human, cars on the road and others objects. In addition, the object detection in the video file at the moment will help a lot in real life, we will cover object detection in videos, including image classification , localization , object recognition and image search, various object detection techniques, motion estimation, object tracking in video.
